### Welcome to bamazon!

Bamazon is a storefront app that uses **MySQL** and **Node.js**.

When the app is started, it asks the user if they would like to purchase something from the store, and the user has the option to type "y" for yes and "n" for no.

If the user selects no, they are given a message that thanks them for stopping by.

![Answer No](https://github.com/ryanweingart/bamazon/blob/master/Images/Answer%20No.png)

If the user selects yes, they are presented with a table of items that are available for purchase. Each item contains the following:

* Item Number
* Product Name
* Department
* Price
* Quantity
