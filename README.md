### Welcome to bamazon!

Bamazon is a storefront app that uses **MySQL** and **Node.js**.

When the app is started, it asks the user if they would like to purchase something from the store, and the user has the option to type "y" for yes and "n" for no.

If the user selects no, they are given a message that thanks them for stopping by.

If the user selects yes, they are presented with a table of items that are available for purchase. Each item contains the following:

* Item Number
* Product Name
* Department
* Price
* Quantity

The user is then asked which item they would like to buy, or they can choose to type the word "exit" if they would like to get out of the app, as shown below:

If the user enters an item, they are asked how many they would like to buy. After the user enters an amount, and there is enough of that item in stock, they are presented with the total for their purchase and asked if they would like to purchase another item.
